                <h2>why face mask is still necessary?</h2>

                <p> From recent studies, it is known that a significant portion of individual with corona virus lack symtoms(pre-symtomatic) can transmit the virus to others before showing symtos, according to Adversory Published by CDC.
                    This simply means that the can spread between people interacting in close proximity- for example, Coughing, Sneezing, or speaking - even if those people are not exibiting symtoms. So in respect to the above evidence, i suggest that proper use of mask in public setting is neccessary, this is very especially where social distancing may be difficult to observed(Super market, Petrol station, Market, pharmacies, Grocery stores etc).

                </p>

                </p>Seconly, it is very pertinent to evryone to have and use a face covering material as statistics shows that masks are the likely reason why the virus has been better control in countries like China, South Korea, Japan and other Countries.

                <p>
                    I strongly believed that the use of face mask combining with other preventive measures will help alot in combating this menace.
                </p> This material can be easily made usin simple cloth materials. ther are surgical mask and the home made very affordable to everyone.

                <p>Note: Wearing mask serve as a barrier to protect you(the user) and others (the environment) from viral particulates because it with provide a bit of protevtion.

                    according to Padwick(Health line), wearing of a mask is good for two reasonsd, its going to cut down 95% of the breathing that sends the Virus up to 6feet away in a room, and also by preventing the Virus from grtting into your nose or mouth, if you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.
